Welcome back! This week's session will introduce you to the most important visualization approaches in R.   `r emo::ji("artist_palette")`

We will learn the fundamentals of data visualization with `ggplot` including bar plots, scatter plots, density plots, boxplots, histograms, correlation plots, heat maps, etc.


***
# Introduction to `ggplot2`

`ggplot2` is by far the most popular visualization package in **R**. `ggplot2` implements the **grammar of graphics** to render a versatile syntax of creating visuals. The underlying logic of the package relies on deconstructing the structure of graphs (if you are interested in this you can read this [article](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf)). You can access the data visualization with `ggplot2` cheat sheet [here](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf).

For the purposes of this introduction to data visualization with ggplot, we care about the layered approach taken by `ggplot2`.

```{r, fig.align='center', echo=F, out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54796579/94537983-b94fa100-0243-11eb-8d12-c2e685141092.png")
```

## Our building blocks `r emo::ji("bricks")`

- **Data**: the data frame(s) we will use to plot
- **Aesthetics**: the variables we will be working with
- **Geometric objects**: the type of visualization
- **Theme adjustments**: size, text, colors, etc.

---

### Data 

The first building block for our plots are the data we intend to map. In `ggplot2`, we always have to specify the object where our data lives. In other words, you will always have to specify a data frame, as such:

```r
ggplot(name_of_your_df)
```

Later on, we will see how to combine multiple data sources to build a single plot. For now, we will work under the assumption that all of your data live in the same object. Consider using `dplyr::left_join()`, `broom::augment()`, or similar functions to combine data sets or to complement your original data set with information from your models (e.g. fitted values). 

---

### Aesthetics 

The second building block for our plots is the aesthetics. We need to specify the variables in the data frame we will be using and what role they play. 

To do this we will use the function `aes()` within the `ggplot()` function following the data frame.

```r
ggplot(name_of_your_df, aes(x = your_x_axis_variable, y = your_y_axis_variable))
```

Beyond defining your axes, you can add more aesthetics representing further dimensions of the data in the two-dimensional graphic plane such as size, color, and fill, just to name a few.

---

### Geometric objects 

The third layer to render our graph (i.e., to produce a specific type of graph, e.g. bar plot, scatter plot, etc.) is a geometric object. To add one, we need to add a plus (`+`) at the end of the initial line of code and then state the type of geometric object we want to add. For example, `geom_point()` to produce a scatter plot or `geom_bar()` to produce a bar plot. For an overview of the most important functions and geoms available through `ggplot2`, see the `ggplot2` [cheat sheet](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/data-visualization.pdf).

```r
ggplot(name_of_your_df, aes(x = your_x_axis_variable, y = your_y_axis_variable)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

### Theme and Axes

At this point, our plot may just need some final touches. We may want to fix the axes names or get rid of the default gray background. To do so, we need to add an additional layer preceded by a plus sign (`+`). 

If we want to change the names in our axes, we can utilize the `labs()` function. 

We can also employ some of the pre-loaded themes, for example, `theme_minimal()`.

```r
ggplot(name_of_your_df, aes(x = your_x_axis_variable, y = your_y_axis_variable)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Name you want displayed",
       y = "Name you want displayed")
```

---

```{r, echo=T, results='hide', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
pacman::p_load(
  tidyverse,
  foreign,
  palmerpenguins,
  haven,
  gapminder,
  gridExtra,
  viridis
  )

df <- gapminder # let's make a copy of the data 
str(df)
```

## Exercise 1 - Your first plot `r emo::ji("penguin")`

For your first plot using `ggplot2`, we will use the `penguins` data set again. 

We would like to create a scatter plot that illustrates the relationship between the length of a penguin's flipper and their weight.

To do so, we need three of our building blocks:

1. Data
1. Aesthetics
1. A geometric object (`geom_point()`)

Once we have our scatter plot, adapt the code to: 

1. Use color to convey another variable (e.g., the species of penguin)
1. Change the axes names
1. Render the graph with `theme_minimal()`

If you want to know more about the `par`, `mar`, `mgp`, and `las` functions in R, see [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-use-par-function-in-r/), [here](https://r-charts.com/base-r/margins/), [here](https://www.programmingr.com/content/controlling-margins-and-axes-oma-and-mgp/), and [here](apparentlyhttps://r-charts.com/base-r/margins/).

```{r, figures-side, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, echo=F}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

That was the first step towards understanding the basic structure of the layers. Let's have a closer look at what plot types makes sense in which situations. The question is, how can we convey the information most effectively? 

# Plotting distributions `r emo::ji("bar_chart")`

If we are interested in plotting distributions of our data, we can leverage geometric objects such as: 

- `geom_histogram()`: visualizes the distribution of a single continuous variable by dividing the x axis into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin (the default is 30 bins).
- `geom_density()`: computes and draws kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.
- `geom_bar()`: renders barplots and in plotting distributions behaves in a very similar way from `geom_histogram()` (can also be used with two dimensions)
- `geom_boxplot()`: box plots can show distributions of variables across groups (you could also consider them as plots for relationships: between a continuous and a categorical variable)

## Histograms

Histograms show the distribution of continuous variables. In this first example, we graph the distribution of the life expectancy variable (i.e., `lifeExp`).

```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 3}
summary(df$lifeExp)
ggplot(df,
       aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

What conclusions might you draw from the histogram above about the distribution of life expectancy worldwide?

*The distribution is not normal (i.e. not a bell curve). It is bimodal with a skew to the left. There is a cluster of country-year observations that has a lower life expectancy (approximately 45-60 years), and a cluster of countries with much higher life expectancies (approx 70 years).*

The default number of bins is 30, which means that the entire range of the variable (here 23.60 to 82.60) is split into 30 equally spaced bins. We can change the number of bins manually. Below, we specify 60 bins to approximate a binwidth of 1 year, **taking into account the range of the variable** `lifeExp`.

```{r,  warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 3}
max(df$lifeExp) - min(df$lifeExp) # approx 60 years
ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60)
```

What would happen if we specified 5 bins?

## Density plots
We saw that the shape of the distribution is highly influenced by *how many bins* we specify. If we specify too few, we run the risk of masking a lot of variation within the bins. If we specify too many bins, we trade parsimony for granularity -- which might make it harder to draw conclusions about the overall distribution of the variable of interest from the graph.

Density plots are continuous alternatives to histograms that do not rely on bins. We will not cover details about the mechanics behind density plots and their estimation here. Just know that we can interpret the height of the density curve in a similar way to how we interpreted the height of the bars in a histogram: The higher the curve, the more observations we have at that specific value of the variable of interest. In this first example, we use the `geom_density()` function to create the density plot.

```{r, warning=F, message=F, fig.height=3}
ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density()
```

## Boxplots `r emo::ji("package")`

Another way to show the distribution of variables across groups are boxplots. Boxplots graph different properties of a distribution:

* The borders of the box denote the 25th and 75th percentile.
* The line within the box denotes the median.
* The position of the whiskers (vertical lines) denote the first quantile value minus 1.5 times the interquartile range and the third quantile value plus 1.5 times the interquartile range. We will not get into the details here.
* Dots denote outliers (values that lie outside the whiskers), if applicable.

In `ggplot2` we can graph boxplots across multiple variables using the `geom_boxplot()` geometric object. Here, the continuous variable (i.e. `lifeExp`) should be specified as the `y` variable, and the categorical variable (i.e. `continent`) as the `x` variable.

 We can flip the axes by using the `coord_flip()` command.
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(subset(df), aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.2, color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Continent",
       y = "Life expectancy in years") +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Violin Plots `r emo::ji("violin")`

A violin plot is a compact display of a continuous distribution. It is a blend of `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_density()`: a violin plot is a mirrored density plot displayed in a similar way as a boxplot.

```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 6, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(subset(df), aes(x = continent, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Continent",
       y = "Life expectancy in years") +
  theme_bw() +
  coord_flip()
```

## Exercise 2 - Distributions 

This is a histogram presenting the weight distribution of penguins in our sample. 
Let's adapt the code of our histogram:

1. Add `bins = 15` argument (try out different numbers)
1. Add `fill = "#FF6666"` (or type "red" instead of "#FF6666")
1. Change the geom to `_density` and `_bar`
1. Consider what data would be good to display in a box plot or violin plot

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, echo=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_histogram()

# YOUR CODE HERE
```

---
 
# Plotting relationships `r emo::ji("handshake")`

## Scatterplots

In their basic form, scatter plots are used to display values of two variables on a Cartesian coordinate system. Below, we inspect the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy.

```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(df, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Economic wealth and life expectancy",
       x = "GDP per capita",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  theme_light()
```

The plot above shows a large amount of clustering (and overplotting) on the left side of the plot, while the right side of the plot is sparsely populated. This makes it hard to gauge the relationship between the two variables. Below, we make a few adjustments to the graph to better display the relationship.

```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(df, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4,
             size = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Economic wealth and life expectancy",
       x = "GDP per capita",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  theme_light()
```

## Scaling the data

One reason why the plot above is hard to read is rooted in the shape of the distribution of the GDP per capita variable. GDP per capita has a strong right skew (yes, right, look at where the *tail* of the distribution is). Below I am plotting the average on top of the graph using the `geom_vline()`.

```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 4}
av = mean(df$gdpPercap)

ggplot(df,
       aes(x = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Untransformed distribution") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = av, color = "red")
```

We can correct for this skew and transform the variable to have a more "normal" distribution by taking the logarithm with base 10. There are multiple ways to do this.

1. Create a new variable (not shown below)
2. Take the natural logarithm within the `aes()` statement when specifying the variable to be displayed
3. Using [scales](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_continuous.html) to transform the display. Note that the data is transformed before properties such as the range of the axis are determined.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(df, aes(x = log10(gdpPercap))) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Applying log10 to variable directly") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = log10(av), color = "red")

# Note below that we do NOT need to specify the av in terms of log10
# The entire x-axis is transformed
ggplot(df,
       aes(x = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Transformation using scales") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = av, color = "red")

# Bonus: alternatively could also use scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10")
```

Can you explain the differences between the plot applying the natural log to the variable within the `aes()` function versus using `scale_x_continuous()`?

*Transforming the variable using the natural logarithm within `aes()` causes the x-axis to be displayed in log values. Using `scale_x_continuous()`, the data is transformed in the same way, however, the x-axis is displayed in the original, non-logged version.*

We can use the same principle in bivariate (or multivariate) displays of data. Below, I use the `scale` transformation on the variable and reflect it in the axis label clarify that it is the relationship between life expectancy and the logarithm of GDP per capita that has a strong positive relationship. 
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(df, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4,
             size = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Economic wealth and life expectancy",
       x = "GDP per capita (log10)",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  theme_light()
```

## Adding trend lines

The plot above illustrates a strong positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy. We can highlight the direction and strength of the relationship by adding a trend line using the [`geom_smooth()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_smooth.html) aesthetic. 

The default smoothing method is `loess` for less than 1,000 observations and `gam` (Generalized Additive Models) for observations greater or equal to 1,000. `ggplot2` informs us which smoothing method was used via a message. By default, a 95% confidence interval is added to the trend line. 

In our example, the trend line shows that the negative relationship at higher values of GDP per capita has a much lower precision than the positive relationship we observe for the majority of the observations.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(df, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4,
             size = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Economic wealth and life expectancy",
       x = "ln GDP per capita",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  theme_light() +
  geom_smooth()

#Alternatively, we can add a linear trend line to the data.
ggplot(df, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4,
             size = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Economic wealth and life expectancy",
       x = "ln GDP per capita",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  theme_light() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Finally, we can display separate trendlines for groups of data. For example, suppose we wanted to know how the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy varies by continent. We can pass the grouping variable to the `color` (and/or `linetype`) parameter within the `aes()` function. Below, I further reduce the opacity of the points to avoid overplotting. Note that the color grouping is passed to both the `geom_point()` and the `geom_smooth()` aesthetic.
```{r, warning = F, fig.height = 5}
ggplot(df, aes(x = log(gdpPercap),
               y = lifeExp,
               color = continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2,
             size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Economic wealth and life expectancy",
       x = "ln GDP per capita",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  theme_light() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

## Line plots
Line plots are particularly useful for time series data. Below, we will graph the GDP per capita development of China from 1952 to 2007. We select the data for China by using the `subset()` function on the original data frame.
```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(subset(df, country == "China"),
       aes(x = year,
           y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_line()

# We can add points to the line to highlight which observations are available in the underlying data.
ggplot(subset(df, country == "China"),
       aes(x = year,
           y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point()
```

> **_NOTE:_** For advanced examples of line graphs using *spaghetti plots* please see this [GitHub page](https://github.com/thereseanders/workshop-dataviz-fsu/tree/master/Day1#spaghetti-plots). 


## Heatmaps
Heatmaps are another great way to illustrate trends for many different groups in data. Suppose, we were interested in the strength of the correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita over time and space. 

Below, we use our data wrangling skills from the last sessions to compute the correlation between the variables `lifeExp` and `gdpPercap` for each continent. Note that we exclude "Oceania" for this exercise.
```{r}
# Compute Pearson correlation coefficient by year and continent
cors <- df %>% 
  filter(continent != "Oceania") %>% 
  group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  summarise(cor = cor(lifeExp, log10(gdpPercap)))
```

We can use the `geom_tile()` geom to create the heatmap; specifying the variable we want to display in color via the `fill` command. We can improve the left plot in a number of ways. First, the color scheme is not necessarily intuitive. The colors aren't separated enough to best display smaller differences in the correlation coefficient, because they are based on the same hue. We can customize our colors to display a gradient with multiple hues.
```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(cors, aes(x = year, y = continent, fill = cor)) +
  geom_tile()

ggplot(cors, aes(x = year, y = continent, fill = cor)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "darkblue", high = "red")
```

We can also use existing color gradient schemes to better distinguish values in our plot. Below, we use color scales from the [viridis package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html). We also give the legend a more informative title.

Using color scales from the `viridis` package is a favorite among many who use `R` for data visualization. First developed for `matplotlib` in Python, this palette offers the following advantages: 

* It is visually appealing 
* *Perceptual uniformity*: visual perception of change is proportionate to incremental changes in the data. 
* High contrast: optimal for printing in black-and-white and easier to read for people with color blindness[^1]

[^1]: For more information about the logic behind developing the viridis palette, see [this blog post](https://www.r-bloggers.com/ggplot2-welcome-viridis/). 

Second, we know that the correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. We only have positive values here and they range from approximately 0.3 to 0.9. It is good practice to show at least one end point of the possible values in legends or axes. Therefore, below we extend the legend to display values from 0 to 1.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(cors, aes(x = year, y = continent, fill = cor)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "inferno", name = "Correlation")

range(cors$cor)

ggplot(cors, aes(x = year, y = continent, fill = cor)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "inferno", name = "Correlation",
                     limits = c(0, 1))
```

Bonus: To improve on this graph, we can add some of the other elements offered by the `ggplot2` package. 

```{r,  warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 6}
ggplot(cors, aes(x = year, y = continent, fill = cor)) +
  geom_tile(color = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis(option = "inferno", name = "Correlation\ncoefficient",
                     limits = c(0, 1)) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       title = "Correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita") +
  
  # Changing appearance of the plot
  theme_light() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        legend.key.width = unit(1.5, "cm"),
        panel.border=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  
  # Adjust x axis labels
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(cors$year)) +
  
  # Reduce space between plot and labels
  coord_cartesian(expand = 0)
```

## Barplots
Suppose we wanted to visualize global population growth over time. We might first want to compute the total population per continent and year.
```{r, message=F, warning =F}
globalpop <- df %>% 
  group_by(continent, year) %>% 
  
  # Need to transform int to num to prevent integer overflow
  summarise(pop_tot = sum(as.numeric(pop)))
```

`ggplot2()` is pretty nice and it just stacked each continent's population on top of each other. This is nice because it it automatically allows us to visualize the sum across continents. Try to verify that the height of each bar is truly the sum of all continents' population. We could illustrate that these are indeed separate continents by passing a `fill` argument within `aes()`. If we instead wanted a separate bar for each continent, we can use the `position` parameter within `geom_col()`. 
```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

# stacked
ggplot(globalpop, aes(x = year, y = pop_tot, fill = continent)) +
  geom_col()

# separate bars
ggplot(globalpop,
       aes(x = year, y = pop_tot, fill = continent)) +
  geom_col(position = position_dodge())
```

Suppose we wanted to know which countries in Europe are shrinking and which countries are growing in terms of their population. We can use our data wrangling skills to compute the most recent change in population by taking the current value and subtracting the previous year's value. 
```{r}
diff07 <- df %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  arrange(year) %>% 
  mutate(fd = pop - dplyr::lag(pop))
```

Below, we plot the change in population for European countries in 2007.
```{r,  warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(subset(diff07, continent == "Europe" & year == 2007),
       aes(x = country, y = fd)) +
  geom_col()
```

This is really hard to see. Lets flip the axes using `coord_flip()`. This could useful because countries are ordered alphabetically, but visually, it is is confusing. Let's reorder the country axis based on the value of the population change. The default is ro order the points in ascending order from the origin.
```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", fig.height = 6 , warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(subset(diff07, continent == "Europe" & year == 2007),
       aes(x = country, y = fd)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip()

ggplot(subset(diff07, continent == "Europe" & year == 2007),
       aes(x = reorder(country, fd), y = (fd/1e+6))) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "", y = "Population change in millions")

## Exercise 3 - Relationships

You now know that we can utilize graphs to explore how different variables are related. In fact, we did so before in our very first scatterplot. We can also use box plots and lines to show some of these relationships.

1. Create a boxplot showcasing the distribution of weight by species.
2. Adapt our very first plot with lines that best fit the observed data by species.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F, echo=F}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```

# Graph appearance `r emo::ji("nail_care")`

The default graphs we have produced so far are not (yet) ready for publication. In particular, they lack informative labels. In addition, we might want to change the appearance of the graph in terms of size, color, linetype, etc.

## Title, subtitle, and axes titles
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(df,aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "A bimodal distribution",
       caption = 'Source: Gapminder package',
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density")
```

## Axis ranges
By default, `ggplot()` adjusted the x-axis to start not at zero but at approximately 23 to reduce the amount of empty space in the plot. We can manually adjust the range of the axes using the `coord_cartesian()` parameter.
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 5}
ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 85))
```

**Caution!!** You will sometimes see the command `scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 85))` instead of `coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 85))`. Note that these are not the same. `coord_cartesian()` only adjusts the range of the axes (it "zooms" in and out), while `scale_y_continuous(limits = c())` subsets the data. For density plots, this does not make a difference. But there are other examples where it alters the actual shape of the graph, rather than just the part of the graph that is visible.

## Coloring

Any changes to the appearance of the curve itself are made within the argument that specifies the geometric object to be plotted, here `geom_line()`. `R` knows many colors by name; for a great overview see this [resource](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf).  

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density(color = "darkblue") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density")

ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density(color = "#2727ff") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density")
```

We can also use hexadecimal or RGB (red, green, blue) strings to specify colors. There are plenty of online tools to pick colors and extract hexadecimal or RBG strings. One of my favorites is [this one](http://www.colorhexa.com). This online tool allows you to specify a color name, hexadecimal, or RGB string, and returns information on color schemes, complementary colors, as well as alternative shades, tints, and tones. It also offers a color blindness simulator.

Suppose, I like the general tone of the darkblue color above but am worried that it is a bit too dark for my plot. I enter the color "darkblue" into the search field at http://www.colorhexa.com and look for a brighter alternative. Suppose I really like the color displayed in the second tile from the left on the tints scale. I can extract this color's hexadecimal value of `#2727ff` by hovering over the tile of that color.

Another good source for color schemes is [colorbrewer2](https://colorbrewer2.org), which also has an R binding, `RColorBrewer`. 


## Line types and width

We can adjust the *type* of the line via the `linetype` parameter within `geom_line()`. For an overview of line types see [here](http://sape.inf.usi.ch/quick-reference/ggplot2/linetype).

We can adjust the *width* of the line via the `size` parameter within `geom_line()`. Note that the `size` parameter is universal in the way that it controls line width in line plots and point size in scatter plots.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density", 
            color = "#2727ff",
            linetype = "dotdash") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density")

ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density", 
            color = "#2727ff",
            linetype = "dotdash",
            size = 2) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density")
```

## Opacity

We can adjust the *opacity* via the `alpha` parameter within any geometric object. The `alpha` parameter ranges between zero and one. Adjusting the opacity of the geometric objects is especially important when plotting multiple lines, points (or other objects) in the same graph to reduce overplotting.

```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 4}
ggplot(df, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4, color = "#2727ff") +
  labs(title = "Economic wealth and life expectancy",
       x = "GDP per capita (log10)",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  theme_light()
```

## Symbols/shapes

We can adjust the default symbol used by `ggplot2` to display the points. The parameter is called [`shape`](http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-point-shapes).

We can also have groups of data displayed using different point shapes. Below, we group by continent. We subset the data to just the year 2007 to de-clutter the plot.
```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(df, aes(x = log(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.4,
             size = 0.5,
             shape = 4) +
  labs(title = "Economic wealth and life expectancy",
       x = "GDP per capita (log10)",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  theme_light()

ggplot(subset(df, year == 2007),
       aes(x = log(gdpPercap),
           y = lifeExp,
           shape = continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Economic wealth and life expectancy",
       subtitle = "2007",
       x = "GDP per capita (log10)",
       y = "Life expectancy") +
  theme_light()
```


## Themes

We can alter the appearance of any element in the plot. Below, we change the pre-specified `theme` that `ggplot2` uses to determine the appearance of the plot. Popular options are `theme_bw()`, `theme_minimal()` or `theme_light()`. For a full list of themes, see [ggtheme](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html). 


# Comparing groups `r emo::ji("apple")``r emo::ji("pear")`

## Using different colors

Sometimes, we want to compare distributions across different groups in our data set. Suppose, we wanted to assess the distribution of the life expectancy on different continents. We can use the `table()` function to get an overview over the groups in our data.
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 5}
table(df$continent)
```

We pass a separate color to the distribution of the `lifeExp` for each continent by specifying the `color` parameter within the aesthetics. Remember, to remove the `color` parameter from the `geom_line()` function. The ability to pass a second variable to the graph with just one aesthetic (here: color) is where the true power of `ggplot2` for data visualization lies. 
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7}
ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_bw()
```

What is the difference between specifying the `color` parameter outside the `aes()` argument versus within the `aes()` argument?

*If the color parameter is specified outside the `aes()` argument, one color is passed all geometric objects of the same type. If the color parameter is specified within the `aes()` argument, different colors are passed to each value of the variable that is passed to the `color` parameter. A separate geometric object will be plotted for value--each in a different color.*

We can adjust the colors used in the plot in a variety of ways. Below, we first use the `scale_color_manual()` function. This will change the colors in both the plot and the legend, based on our manual specification. Within the `scale_color_manual()` argument, we can also specify a name and labels for the legend.

There are a ton of resources and packages with pre-defined color schemes. The most popular is [colorbrewer2](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3). You can either pick the desired colors manually, or use the `scale_color_brewer()` function in `ggplot2()`.

```{r, fig.show="hold", out.width="50%", warning=F, message=F}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) # to let the figures sit side by side

ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Africa" = "darkorange",
                                "Americas" = "darkblue",
                                "Europe" = "darkgreen",
                                "Asia" = "darkred",
                                "Oceania" = "purple2"),
                     name = "Continent")

ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "BrBG",
                     name = "Continent")
```

Check out the list of color palettes compiled by [Emil Hvitfeldt](https://github.com/EmilHvitfeldt/r-color-palettes/blob/master/type-sorted-palettes.md#sequential-color-palettes). There is even a Wes Anderson movies inspired color scheme available using the package [wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson#the-isle-of-dogs-2018)! Another popular option are the color schemes from the [viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) package due to their desirable properties with respect to colorblindness and printability. 


## Using different linetypes

Many academic journals will only accept graphs on a gray scale. This means that color will not be enough to differentiate five lines. We can use different line types instead by specifying the `linetype` parameter within the `aes()` argument. This also makes the graph more color blind friendly. Notice below that in order to combine the legends for the `linetype` and `color` aesthetics, we need to pass the same name within the `scale` function.
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp, color = continent, linetype = continent)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_bw() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1",
                     name = "Continent") +
  scale_linetype_discrete(name = "Continent")
```


## Faceting

Another option to graph different groups is to use faceting. This means to plot each value of the variable upon which we facet in a different panel within the same plot. Here, we will use the `facet_wrap()` function. 
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, nrow = 1)
```

We can use the `facet_grid()` to create facets across more than one variable. Suppose, we were interested in the evolution of the distribution of the life expectancy over time for each continent.

Oceania causing the y-axis to have a large range, which makes the values for the other continents hard to see. There are different ways to deal with this (hint: check out the `scales = "free"` command). Below, we simply exclude Oceania, since it is only comprised of Australia and New Zealand. We can either create a new subsample data frame, or use the `subset()` command directly within `ggplot()`. 

```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 9, fig.width = 8}
ggplot(subset(df, continent != "Oceania"),
       aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_line(stat = "density") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of global life expectancy 1952-2007",
       subtitle = "Data source: Gapminder package",
       x = "Life expectancy in years",
       y = "Density") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_grid(year ~ continent)
```


## Exercise 4 - Groups and Relationships

Create a plot to compare the GDP per capita development of the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). Unfortunately, Russia (or previously the Soviet Union) is not part of the `gapminder` data, so we cannot display it in the plot. 

Please create a publication-ready graph that can be printed (do you have ideas what we could do for grayscale printing?). 

```{r, warning = F, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4, echo = FALSE, message = F}
# YOUR CODE HERE
```


```{r, warning = F, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 8, echo = FALSE, message = F}
ggplot(
  subset(df, country %in% c("Brazil", "Russia", "China", "India", "South Africa")),
  aes(x = year,
      y = gdpPercap)) +
  geom_line(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.8,
             size = 0.4) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "GDP per capita in BRICS countries",
       x = "Year",
       y = "GDP per capita") +
  facet_wrap(~country, nrow = 1) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1950,2000, 25))

```


# Saving plots  `r emo::ji("floppy_disk")`

We can output your plots to many different format using the `ggsave()` function, including but not limited to `.pdf`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`, or `.eps`. Here, we output the graph as a Portable Network Graphics (.png) file. We can specify the size of the output graph as well as the resolution in dots per inch (dpi). If no graph is specified, `ggsave()` will save the last graph that was executed. If we no not specify the complete file path, the plot will be saved to your working directory.
```{r, warning = F, message = F}
# ggsave("panel_lifeexp_continent.png", width = 6, height = 3, dpi = 400)
```

Alternatively, we could save the plot as an `R` object and pass the object name to `ggsave()`. Also, remember our project folder structure we discussed in one of the first weeks. You might have an image or output folder in your project directory.
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 3}
p1 <- ggplot(df,
       aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density()

#ggsave("lifeexp_dens.png", width = 3, height = 2, dpi = 300, p1)

# or with a more precise folder structure:
#ggsave("output/images/lifeexp_dens.png", width = 3, height = 2, dpi = 300, p1)
```

Manually, you could also visit the `Plots` pane in the RStudio interface and export the graph as image or pdf.

Oftentimes, we want our plots not only to be displayed side by side in an html output, but we actually want to save it as a two (or more) image file. The function `grid.arrange()` from the `gridExtra` package - see this [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/egg/vignettes/Ecosystem.html) for more information- can be very helpful here.
```{r, warning = F, message = F, fig.height = 2, fig.width = 5}
p1 <- ggplot(df, aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_density()

p2 <- ggplot(df,aes(x = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram()

p3 <- grid.arrange(p1, p2, nrow = 1)
p3
#ggsave("lifeexp_double.png", width = 6, height = 2, dpi = 300, p3)
```

Now that you have been introduced to some of the basics of `ggplot2`, **the best way to move forward is to experiment**. As we have discussed before, the **R** community is very open. Perhaps, you can gather some inspiration from the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) social data project in R where users explore a new dataset each week and share their visualizations and code on Twitter under \#TidyTuesday. You can explore some of the previous visualizations [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/tidy-tuesday.html) and try to replicate their code.

[Here](https://github.com/erikgahner/awesome-ggplot2) and [here](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/) are curated lists of awesome `ggplot2` resources. Other cool plot forms to check out are, for example, parallel plots, spaghetti plots, interactive plots, maps, three dimensional plots, network graphs, etc. 
Of course, there will also be some really cool visualization content in the workshops!!

In case you're already thinking about Christmas gifts, want to have some more color on your walls or - just in case you are bored by this course, check out some *generative art* or play around with some open projects, for example, by [Katharina Brunner](https://katharinabrunner.de/generativeart/), [Ijeamaka](https://twitter.com/ijeamaka_a) or [Sharla Gelfand](https://twitter.com/sharlagelfand) - all **conducted in R**!
